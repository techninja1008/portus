# This script will ensure Portus' database is ready to be used. It will keep
# waiting for the db to be usable, but the script will exit with an error
# after a certain amount of failed attempts.
#
# The script will automatically import all the SSL certificates from
# `/certificates` into the final system. This is needed to talk with the
# registry API when this one is protected by TLS.
#
# Finally the script will start apache running Portus via mod_rails.
